# train-announcment-system

This is the Train Announcment System Using Python, where we have made the automatic announcement system without human interference. Here there is no need of humans manking the manual announcements every now and then. The announcements can be made using pre-recorded set of audios and playing it whenever neccesary using python. The announcement can be made in Hindi and English both languages.  
Also there is LED display board of trains arriving while on-going announcements. 

Along with the main code I have also attached some of the pre=recorded set of audio files in .mp3 format.
